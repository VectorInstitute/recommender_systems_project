    "Content-Based Recommendation systems use item features to recommend other similar items to users based on what they like, their previous actions, or explicit feedback. In this tutorial, we specifically focus on the retrieval or candidate generation stage of recommender systems in which the initial set of candidates is selected out of all the possible candidates. \n",

    "The Movielens dataset is a popular dataset from the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) research group at the University of Minnesota. It contains a set of ratings given to movies by a set of users, and is often used for recommender system research.\n",

    "In this demo, the data will be treated as an implicit feedback: expressesing which movies the users watched (and rated), and which they did not. Thus, a users' watches gives information about which things they prefer to see and which they'd rather not see. Every movie a user has watched is a positive example and every movie they have not seen is a negative example.\n",

    "In a study conducted on e-commerce data from e-bay, this approach was shown to have improved results over an existing Recently-Viewed-Item (RVI) method. The existing method recommends items that a user has recently viewed ranked by the viewed item’s recency; RVI is widely used as a way of generating personalized recommendations in production systems. It is also a difficult baseline to beat in terms of generating user engagement, given that these are items the user has engaged with recently. It has also been shown to outperform CF-based\n",

    "This method outperformed the RVI method in several Recall@k metrics that were\n",

    "\n",
    "In an online evaluation, initial A/B test results showed that compared to the current personalized recommendation module in production, the proposed method increases the conversion rate by ∼6% to generate recommendations for 90% of listing page impressions.\n",
