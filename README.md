# Introduction 
The goal of this project is to explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence in Customer Experience, specifically Recommender Systems. This repository contains reference implementations of state-of-the-art recommender system methods on a variety of practical datasets. In particular, three classes of recommender systems are explored. This includes: 
1. Sequence Aware Recommender Systems
2. Session-Based Recommender Systems 
3. TBD
