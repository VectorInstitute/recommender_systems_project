# Introduction 
The goal of this project is to explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence in Customer Experience, specifically Recommender Systems. This repository contains reference implementations of state-of-the-art recommender system methods on a variety of practical datasets. In particular, three classes of recommender systems are explored. This includes: 
1. Introduction to Recommender Systems
2. Sequence Aware Recommender Systems
3. Session-Based Recommender Systems 

# Environment Configuration 
From the root directory of the repo, run the following commands:
```
conda create -n recsys python=3.7
conda activate recsys 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
